            8 months after initial release, albumle gets its first major update!
            This update is a complete overhaul of the original version, with
            improved UI, UX, and a new backend. Here's the details:

            This update was mainly supposed to be silent with only a backend
            change, however, I went all out and decided to also port the
            frontend to React.

            Can you try and guess the album cover in 6 tries or less? Each
            attempt reduces the pixelation, making it slightly easier on each
            guess. Inspired by Wordle, come back everyday to play again to a new
            album.

            ...Is this original description for this game. This changelog didn't
            exist at the time of release, so it's present me here about to talk
            about some nonsense from the past:
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The idea of albumle goes back to probably late 2021/early 2022.
            Can't exactly remember, but it was when all those alt. Wordle games
            started popping up. I never really coded seriously back then, so I
            thought creating a web game would be a fun way to learn more.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I could keep typing about stuff but for now we'll leave it at that.
